## What is Modules?
Modules is an Electron-based application, developed with Typescript, to house sub-applications for it.  
  
Plugin-based architecture is difficult to implement, especially if you're loading the plugins (or in this case, modules) at runtime. This application is designed to streamline that process for both the developer and the user.


## Example: [Volume Controller Module](https://github.com/aarontburn/modules-volume_controller) 
(TODO: Put an image here)
<br/>  
This module is a substitute for the Windows Audio Mixer and includes additional functions.

## Developing a module:
